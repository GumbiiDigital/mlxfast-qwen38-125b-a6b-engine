# stage-baseline-workspace.sh -- build the organizer's REFERENCE tree on a
# ranked box.
#
# WHAT THE REFERENCE TREE IS. A ranked run on this track is PAIRED (David ruling
# 2026-09-08): it measures a SERIAL-CONTROL leg on the organizer's reference
# tree and a CANDIDATE leg on the submission tree, in the same job, on the same
# box. The score is the LIVE ratio of the two. The reference tree is therefore
# the denominator's engine, and it must be ONE known thing: a checkout of this
# repository at the fixture's baseline_reference_commit, built the documented
# way. This script makes that tree, and nothing else does.
#
# NOTHING IN THE RANKED JOB RUNS THIS. The job holds no credential and builds no
# reference tree (bundles-no-keys, ruled 2026-08-21): it only VERIFIES that the
# tree an operator staged is at the pinned commit with its worker staged
# (tools/ranked-box-preflight.sh section 6, and the workflow's own reference
# check). An operator runs this script by hand when the organizer re-baselines.
#
# NO CREDENTIAL HERE EITHER. The clone source is a box-staged bare mirror or a
# git bundle, never github.com: this box has no key and needs none. The commit
# is checked out by sha, and the resulting HEAD is verified against the fixture
# before the script reports success, so a mirror that lacks the pinned commit
# fails closed rather than staging a different tree under the right name.
#
# THE BUILD IS THE DOCUMENTED ONE, not a shortcut: the two `swift build`
# invocations setup.sh runs (the trusted CLI, then the worker under its own
# scratch root), then the Metal library, then tools/stage-bench-worker.sh, which
# copies the finished set -- the worker, its mlx.metallib and the metallib's
# fingerprint sidecar -- into .build/release, where benchd resolves the engine.
# A box with the Command Line Tools only cannot compile Metal; on such a box set
# MLXFAST_METALLIB_STAGE and pass --prestaged-metallib, which adopts a
# pre-built pair after checking its fingerprint against this checkout's own
# vendored sources.
#
# THE TREE TRANSFORMS ITS OWN WEIGHTS. The control leg runs on the pinned commit
# END TO END -- its engine, its Metal library AND the weights its own transform
# produced -- so this script runs the transform in the reference tree exactly as
# the ranked job runs it for the candidate:
#
#   .build/release/mlxfast-swift transform --reference "${MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR}" --output weights
#
# Sharing the candidate's transformed tree instead would put a submission's
# transform on both sides of the ratio, which is the one thing a control leg
# exists to prevent. MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR is the box's verified checkpoint, the
# same name the ranked job reads.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/stage-baseline-workspace.sh <dir> [--prestaged-metallib] [--dry-run]
#
#   <dir>                   where the reference tree is created. It must not
#                           already exist, or must be empty: this script never
#                           writes into a tree it did not make, because an
#                           existing tree may be the one a run is using.
#   --prestaged-metallib    adopt MLXFAST_METALLIB_STAGE's mlx.metallib pair
#                           instead of compiling Metal here.
#   --dry-run               print every command in order and run none of them.
#                           This is what CI and the offline test exercise; the
#                           real path is box-only.
#
# Env:
#   MLXFAST_BASELINE_SOURCE  the clone source: a bare mirror directory or a
#                            .bundle file of THIS repository, staged on the box.
#                            Required unless --dry-run.
#   MLXFAST_FORK_MIRROR      the bare mirror of the engine fork, used to resolve
#                            the Vendor/mlx-swift-lm submodule without a
#                            credential (the same name and the same insteadOf
#                            rewrite the ranked workflow uses).
#   MLXFAST_METALLIB_STAGE   directory holding mlx.metallib and
#                            mlx.metallib.fingerprint, for --prestaged-metallib.
#   MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR    the box's verified reference checkpoint. The
#                            reference tree's own transform reads it. Required
#                            unless --dry-run.
